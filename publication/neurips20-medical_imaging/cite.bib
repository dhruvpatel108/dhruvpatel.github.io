  abstract = {Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT) imaging is used in the diagnosis of renal cancer
and planning of surgery. A sequence of CECT phase images which captures the
movement of contrast agent inside an organ often completely misses some of the
phase images or has corrupted phase images making the entire sequence useless.
We propose a probabilistic deep generative model for imputing such missing phase
images in CECT imaging. Our proposed model recovers the missing phase images
with quantified uncertainty estimates enabling medical decision-makers make
better-informed decisions. Furthermore, we propose a novel style-based adversarial
loss to learn very fine-scale features unique to CECT imaging resulting in better
recovery. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm using a patient dataset
collected in an IRB-approved retrospective study.
